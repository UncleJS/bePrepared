## 1. About This System

**bePrepared** is a structured household disaster preparedness platform that guides you from first steps to long-term self-sufficiency through:

- **Ticksheets** — actionable, level-based checklists from 72-hour to 90-day readiness
- **Scenario planning** — separate strategies and resource targets for shelter-in-place and evacuation
- **Configurable household targets** — water, calories, and people counts that adapt to your household
- **Lifecycle management** — expiry tracking, replacement cycles, and maintenance scheduling for consumables and equipment
- **Intelligent alerting** — upcoming, due, and overdue notifications prioritised by life-safety relevance
- **Guidance modules** — detailed operational doctrine for Water, Food, Power, Comms, Medical, Shelter, Sanitation, Security, and Mobility

## 2. Documentation Map

Source of truth note: for persisted enums, field names, and API payload semantics, treat [Data Model](./09-data-model.md) and [API Contract](./10-api-contract.md) as canonical. Narrative docs explain behavior and examples, but should defer to those two specs when wording differs.
