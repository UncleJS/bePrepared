## 1. About This System

**bePrepared** is a structured household disaster preparedness platform that guides you from first steps to long-term self-sufficiency through:

- **Ticksheets** — actionable, level-based checklists from 72-hour to 90-day readiness
- **Scenario planning** — separate strategies and resource targets for shelter-in-place and evacuation
- **Configurable household targets** — water, calories, and people counts that adapt to your household
- **Lifecycle management** — expiry tracking, replacement cycles, and maintenance scheduling for consumables and equipment
- **Intelligent alerting** — upcoming, due, and overdue notifications prioritised by life-safety relevance
- **Guidance modules** — detailed operational doctrine for Water, Food, Power, Comms, Medical, Shelter, Sanitation, Security, and Mobility

## 2. Documentation Map

Source of truth note: for persisted enums, field names, and API payload semantics, treat [Data Model](./09-data-model.md) and [API Contract](./10-api-contract.md) as canonical. Narrative docs explain behavior and examples, but should defer to those two specs when wording differs.

## 4. Core Concepts at a Glance

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Readiness Level** | L1=72h, L2=14d, L3=30d, L4=90d |
| **Scenario** | `shelter_in_place` or `evacuation` |
| **Household Profile** | Named people-count that auto-switches by scenario |
| **Policy** | Configurable per-person/day targets (water, calories, alert windows) |
| **Effective value** | Scenario override → global override → system default |
| **Ticksheet** | Checklist of tasks at a readiness level, with dependency tracking |
| **Inventory lot** | Physical batch of a consumable with qty, expiry, and replacement date |
| **Maintenance schedule** | Calendar and/or usage-based service interval for equipment |
| **Alert** | Upcoming / due / overdue notification generated by the worker |
